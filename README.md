# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

Portfolio project to showcase Data Engineering skills including ETL and ML Pipeline preparation, utilising model in a web app, and data visualisation.

### Project Components 

1. ETL Pipeline
The Python script, process_data.py:

    - Loads the messages and categories datasets
    - Merges the two datasets
    - Cleans the data
    - Stores it in a SQLite database

2. ML Pipeline
The Python script, train_classifier.py:

    - Loads data from the SQLite database
    - Splits the dataset into training and test sets
    - Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
    - Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
    - Outputs results on the test set
    - Exports the final model as a pickle file

3. Flask Web App

### File Descriptions

There are three main foleders:
1. data
    - disaster_categories.csv: dataset including all the categories 
    - disaster_messages.csv: dataset including all the messages
    - process_data.py: ETL pipeline scripts to read, clean, and save data into a database
    - DisasterResponse.db: output of the ETL pipeline, i.e. SQLite database containing messages and categories data
2. models
    - train_classifier.py: machine learning pipeline scripts to train and export a classifier
    - classifier.pkl: output of the machine learning pipeline, i.e. a trained classifer
3. app
    - run.py: Flask file to run the web application
    - templates contains html file for the web applicatin

### Results

1. An ETL pipleline was built to read data from two csv files, clean data, and save data into a SQLite database.
2. A machine learning pipepline was developed to train a classifier to performs multi-output classification on the 36 categories in the dataset.
3. A Flask app was created to show data visualization and classify the message that user enters on the web page.

### Requirements
Please check the requirements.txt for complete information about working environment.

Please use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to run it

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
